# Environmental Justice in LA: Lasting impacts of redlining

## Background

The United States has a long history of systemic racism that continues
to permeate society in both obvious and hidden ways. One of the many
consequences of this is the fact that poor or marginalized communities
are exposed to and harmed by air pollution, hazardous waste, resource
extraction, and more at a disproportionate amount. The environmental
justice movement was born from this and has been fighting for community
protection, enforcement of environmental regulations and policies, and
exposing this reality.

One historical reason for the present day conditions can be traced back
to the 1930s. As part of the New Deal, the Home Owner's Loan Corporation
(HOLC) rated neighborhoods based on their perceived safety for real
estate investment. Their ranking system, (A (green), B (blue), C
(yellow), D (red)) was then used to block access to loans for home
ownership. As you might guess, racism played a leading role in the
designation of grades and led to the phenomenon colloquially known as
"redlining." This practice has had widely-documented consequences on
community wealth, environment, and health. [^1] Redlined neighborhoods
have less greenery[^2] and are hotter than other neighborhoods.[^3] Lee
and co-authors, in a meta-analysis, found that "gunshot-related
injuries, asthma, heat-related outcomes, and multiple chronic conditions
were worse in redlined areas."[^4]

A recent study found that redlining has not only affected the
environments and health hazards communities are exposed to, it has also
shaped our observations of biodiversity.[^5] Community or citizen
science, whereby individuals share observations of species on their own
time, is generating an enormous volume of data. In recent years, apps
such as [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) have enabled more
people to identify and report various species of plants and animals.
This increase, however, has also highlighted areas of missingness--where
individuals do not, or cannot, participate in citizen science for
various reasons. Ellis-Soto and co-authors found that redlined
neighborhoods remain the most undersampled areas across 195 US cities.
This gap is highly concerning, because conservation decisions and
policies are made based on these data. If impactful decisions are being
made on inaccurate data, this could lead to actions that continue to
harm poor and marginalized communities.

## Analysis

What lasting impacts does redlining have on the county of Los Angeles?
Now that we know that bird biodiversity data tend to be undersampled in
redlined neighborhoods, is this true in LA?

Let's answer these questions by:

-   Using EJScreen data to map current environmental and demographic
    indicators in LA
-   Comparing current conditions across census block groups in LA that
    were historically redlined
-   Comparing percent of reported bird observations across areas in LA
    that were historically redlined

## Data Descriptions

Three datasets will be used to answer our questions: US EPA EJScreen
data, digitized HOLC maps, and bird biodiveristy observations in LA.

### EJScreen

The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental
Justice Screening and Mapping Tool is an effort to provide national data
for advancing their goals and supporting others interested in
environmental justice.

According to the [US EPA
website](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/purposes-and-uses-ejscreen):

> This screening tool and data may be of interest to community residents
> or other stakeholders as they search for environmental or demographic
> information. It can also support a wide range of research and policy
> goals. The public has used EJScreen in many different locations and in
> many different ways.
>
> EPA is sharing EJScreen with the public:\
> - to be more transparent about how we consider environmental justice
> in our work,\
> - to assist our stakeholders in making informed decisions about
> pursuing environmental justice and,\
> - to create a common starting point between the agency and the public
> when looking at issues related to environmental justice.

EJScreen provides environmental and demographic information for the US
at the Census [tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract) and
[block group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group) levels.
Block group data has been downloaded, and stored locally, from the [EPA
site](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data).

### Mapping Inequality

A team of researchers, led by the [Digital Scholarship
Lab](https://dsl.richmond.edu/) at the University of Richmond have
digitized maps and information from the HOLC as part of the [Mapping
Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58)
project.

This analysis uses maps of HOLC grade designations for Los Angeles via
URL. Information on the data can be found
[here](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=downloads).[^6]

### Biodiversity observations

The [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org) is the largest
aggregator of biodiversity observations in the world. Observations
typically include a location and date that a species was observed. This
analysis will use bird observations in 2022.

## Legacy of Redlining in present-day LA

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(plotly)
library(gt)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
# read in ejscreen data with direct filepath
la_county <- st_read("~/Documents/github/eds223-assignments/assignment-2-amandaherbst/data/EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb/",
                    quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  # filter ejscreen to LA county
  filter(CNTY_NAME == "Los Angeles County")
```

### Wastewater Discharge

The wastewater discharge indicator in EJScreen assigns a score to each
census block group based on the pollution and toxicity of nearby streams
and rivers. LA has limited access to local clean water and often deals
with extremely polluted water, especially after a storm. Let's visualize
the wastewater discharge indicator for LA census block groups and add
points for block groups that are above the 95th percentile of national
values for wastewater discharge. Feel free to zoom in on the map to gain
a better understanding of where the highest wastewater discharge levels
are in the county.

```{r }
# map of LA
# color census block groups by wastewater discharge
# add centroid for block groups above 95th percentile

# filter la dataset for block groups above 95th percentile for wastewater dischare
top_percentile <- la_county %>% 
  filter(P_PWDIS > 95)

# make centroids for block groups above 95th percentile
top_percentile_centroids <- st_centroid(top_percentile)

# map LA county and color census blocks by waste water discharge
m1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = la_county, aes(fill = PWDIS),
          lwd = 0.1,
          color = 'gray') +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1) +
  # add above 95th percentile centroids
  geom_sf(data = top_percentile_centroids,
          color = 'magenta') +
  labs(x = "Longtitude",
       y = "Latitude",
       fill = "Wastewater discharge") +
  # choose x axis breaks so longitude is readable
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-119, -118.6, -118.2, -117.8)) +
  theme_bw()

# make interactive to better see where the centroids are
ggplotly(m1)
```

### Redlining impacts in numbers

Now let's use EJScreen data to investigate demographic (% low income)
and environmental (PM 2.5 and Superfund proximity) indicators.

```{r }
high_inc <- la_county %>% 
  # filter to block groups where % of low income is less than 0.05
  filter(LOWINCPCT < 0.05) %>% 
  # take the resulting number of rows and divide by the total number of block groups
  # multiply by 100 to get percent value
  nrow()/nrow(la_county) * 100

print(paste(round(high_inc,2), "% of LA census block groups have less than 5% of the population considered low income"))
```

That means that the majority of LA census block groups have *over* 5% of
the population considered as low income.

```{r }
# percent of census block groups that are above 80th percentile for both PM 2.5 and Superfund proximity
pm_sf <- la_county %>% 
  filter(P_PM25 > 80 & P_PNPL > 80) %>% 
  nrow() / nrow(la_county) * 100

print(paste(round(pm_sf,2), "% of LA census block groups are above the 80th percentile for both PM 2.5 and Superfund proximity"))
```

Over 1/6 of LA census block groups are excessively exposed to unhealthy
air quality and hazardous waste.

#### LA redlining

How do these stats compare in areas that were historically redlined?

```{r echo = FALSE}
LA_redlining <- st_read("https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/citiesData/CALosAngeles1939/geojson.json",
                        quiet = TRUE) %>%
  st_make_valid()
```

Let's take a look at these areas and their grades first:

```{r }
# plot redlining areas, color by HOLC Grade
m2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = LA_redlining, aes(fill = grade)) +
  scale_fill_discrete(type = c("green", "blue", "yellow", "red", "grey")) +
  labs(x = "Longtitude",
       y = "Latitude",
       fill = "HOLC Grade") +
  theme_bw()

m2
```

Interestingly, the C and D grades make up the majority of the center of
the county, while most of the A and B grades are at the northern part of
the county. Let's investigate the current conditions in these areas.
First up, figure out how many current census block groups fall within
the designated areas above.

```{r}
# transfrom LA_redlining to same crs as la_county
LA_redlining3857 <- st_transform(LA_redlining, st_crs(la_county))

# block groups that have intersecting geometries as LA_redlining HOLC grades
# left = FALSE for an inner join
block_groups_holc_join <- st_join(x = la_county, y = LA_redlining3857, left = FALSE)
holc_block_grps <- nrow(block_groups_holc_join)

print(paste(holc_block_grps, "census block groups in LA fall within areas with HOLC grades"))
```

LA county has a total of 6591 block groups, so this means that the
majority of block groups fall within areas that were historically graded
by the HOLC. When we compare current conditions (environmental and
demographic) in LA block groups by the grade they were historically
assigned, we get this result:

```{r }
# summary table of means grouped by grade
t1 <- block_groups_holc_join %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  summarise(low_inc_pct_avg = mean(LOWINCPCT, na.rm = TRUE),
            p_pm25_avg = mean(P_PM25, na.rm = TRUE),
            p_low_life_exp_avg = mean(P_LIFEEXPPCT, na.rm = TRUE),
            p_cancer_avg = mean(P_CANCER, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Current EJ Conditions in LA by HOLC grade")

t1
```

Based on the averages calculated, the HOLC grade for a census block
group in LA appears to be indicative of the percent of the population
that is low income, as well as the percentiles they fall within for
environmental justice indicators. Groups with a grade of "A" had the
lowest average percent of low income (15%), and had an average of the
lowest percentiles, comparatively, for PM 2.5, low life expectancy, and
air toxics cancer risk. In comparison, areas with a grade of "D" had the
highest average percent of low income (39%) and had the highest average
percentiles for PM 2.5, low life expectancy, and air toxics cancer risk.

### Investigate the legacy of redlining in biodiversity observations

Let's add bird observations in LA from the year 2022 to our analysis. We
want to know if the redlined neighborhoods in LA are undersampled in
terms of bird observations. Calculating the percent of total
observations in each HOLC grade should get us to an answer.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# read in birds data
la_birds <- st_read("~/Documents/github/eds223-assignments/assignment-2-amandaherbst/data/gbif-birds-LA",
                    quiet = TRUE)

# filter birds to 2022
la_birds_22 <- la_birds %>% 
  filter(year == 2022)

# bird observations in neighborhoods with HOLC grades
# inner join using "left = FALSE"
holc_birds <- st_join(LA_redlining, la_birds_22, left = FALSE)

# total number of bird observations
tot_bird <- nrow(holc_birds)

# percent of bird observations by HOLC grade
holc_birds_pct <- holc_birds %>% 
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  summarize(bird_pct_obs = n()/tot_bird * 100)
```

```{r}
# plot % of bird observations by HOLC
ggplot(data = holc_birds_pct) +
  geom_col(aes(x = grade, y = bird_pct_obs, fill = grade),
           show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_discrete(type = c("green", "blue", "yellow", "red", "grey")) +
  labs(x = "HOLC Grade",
       y = "% Bird Observations",
       title = "Bird Observations in Redlining Categories") +
  theme_bw()
```

Based on the findings of Ellis-Soto and co-authors, we would expect to
see high percentages in A and B areas and low percentages in C and D
areas. Surprisingly, the largest share of bird observations are in areas
that were historically graded a C, the second largest share in areas
historically graded a D, or historically redlined areas of Los Angeles.
This could potentially be a result of LA's population skyrocketing since
1933 and consequently leading to gentrification of redlined
neighborhoods.

## Conclusion

Redlining has lasting impacts on environmental and demographic
indicators in LA county census block groups. When comparing across
grades (A to D), we saw percent of low income increase as well as the
percentiles for low life expectancy and exposure to PM 2.5 and air
toxics with cancer risk. Therefore, in line with the research, health
and quality of life decrease in historically redlined areas. However, we
surprisingly found that these areas accounted for a high proportion of
bird biodiversity observations, in contrast with the findings of
Ellis-Soto and co-authors. This may be for a multitude of reasons that
are not yet apparent. The gentrification of redlined neighborhoods is
definitely a possibility.
