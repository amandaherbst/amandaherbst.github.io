# Relationship between cholorphyll-*a* and nutrients in the Santa Barbara Channel

![Santa Barbara Coast](sb_coast.JPG)

## Background

Phytoplankton play a key role in both oceanic food webs and the global
carbon cycle. Although they only make up 0.2% of the global primary
producer biomass, phytoplankton are responsible for nearly half of
Earth's primary production (Field et al 1998). Every marine organism
relies on phytoplankton directly or indirectly for fuel and through
photosynthesis, phytoplankton convert inorganic carbon, CO2, into
organic carbon. It is then essential to study them to understand how
they can mitigate and/or be affected by climate change. Since all
photosynthetically active phytoplankton use chlorophyll-*a*
pigment to produce their own fuel, chlorophyll-*a* is commonly used as a proxy for
phytoplankton biomass.

In order to grow and thrive, phytoplankton rely on certain
nutrients--phosphate (PO4) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (nitrate,
nitrite, ammonium). It has been proven that on short timescales, such as
weeks and months, the previously mentioned nutrients are dominant
drivers of changes in chlorophyll-*a* concentration, with a directly
proportional relationship (Blauw et al 2018).

Coastal ocean waters are teeming with life and are more productive
compared to the open ocean, but are also most vulnerable to climate
change (Sigman and Hain 2012). By growing our understanding of the
chemistry and biology in these coastal areas, we can better protect and
predict future changes due to climate change and ocean acidification.

While learning about the close relationship between chlorophyll-*a* and
nutrients, I began to wonder if, with a large enough dataset, a
statistically significant relationship could be characterized. I knew
that my hometown, Santa Barbara, had a Long-Term Ecological Research
project with years worth of open access coastal chemistry and nutrient
data, so I set out to answer this question with their data.

## Data

The Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program has been
conducting monthly nearshore cruises along the Santa Barbra channel at
16 sites since 2000. Water samples are collected with a rosette sampler
and multiple nutrients and water chemistry parameters are measured. The data
are accessible to anyone on the Environmental Data Initiative or DataOne websites. Included in this dataset are measurements of
chlorophyll-a, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium concentrations,
which I used for my analysis.

## Methods

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(naniar)
library(lubridate)
library(tsibble)
library(feasts)
library(zoo)
library(modelr)
library(sjPlot)
library(patchwork)
```

### Data loading, cleaning, and preparation

I imported the data via a URL leading to the DataOne website, but it could also be downloaded and stored locally.

Initial data cleaning was done in the same step as
importing by piping. The initial data frame was relatively tidy, but needed certain values to be replaced with NAs: any 99999 values where data was missing and nutrient measurements labeled "BDL" for below detection level. 

Since chlorophyll-*a* concentration is driven by phosphate and
*dissolved inorganic nitrogen*, a new column was created with the sum of the components of dissolved inorganic nitrogen: nitrite, nitrate and ammonium. For more accurate sum totals, an intermediate data frame was created in order to convert the NA values to 0. Once the sums were calculated, any sums equaling zero were converted back to NAs and the dissolved inorganic nitrogen column was added via `cbind()` back to the original data frame. Lastly, a new dataframe was created with only the necessary variables for more efficient handling.

```{r}
bottle <- read_delim("https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/https%3A%2F%2Fpasta.lternet.edu%2Fpackage%2Fdata%2Feml%2Fknb-lter-sbc%2F10%2F27%2F572816525903a898f686df5b64eb3852",
                     # BDL = below detection limit, so convert those to NA
                     na = "BDL",
                     show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  # convert any 99999 value to NA values 
  replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x == 99999) %>% 
  # two rows at station Q2 which is not in the meta data and a positive longitude...
  filter(station != "Q2")
# problems(bottle)
# bottle <- read_delim(here("data", "LTER_monthly_bottledata_20220930.txt"), 
                     # BDL = below detection limit, so convert those to NA
                    # na = "BDL") %>% 
```

```{r}
# select preferred nitrogen columns
bottle_nutrients <- bottle %>% 
  select(no2_no3_umol_l, ammonia_umol_l)

# convert any NAs to 0 for more accurate sums
bottle_nutrients[is.na(bottle_nutrients)] <- 0

# create column DIN as sum of the nitrogen components
bottle_nutrients <- bottle_nutrients %>% 
  mutate(din_umol_l = no2_no3_umol_l + ammonia_umol_l)

# convert and 0s back to NA
bottle_nutrients$din_umol_l[bottle_nutrients$din_umol_l == 0] <- NA

# create the data frame we want by adding DIN column and only selecting chl and nutrients
bottle_complete <- bottle %>% 
  cbind(din_umol_l = bottle_nutrients$din_umol_l) %>% 
  select(chl_a_ug_l, po4_umol_l, din_umol_l)
```

### Data exploration

The plan was to run an ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple linear regression between chlorophyll-*a* and phosphate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Before proceeding, I explored the distribution of each of the variables and found that chlorophyll-*a* had some large outliers which created a positive skew and long right tail (Figure 1). In order to account for the outliers and lower the leverage of large values in the model, the log of chlorophyll-*a* concentration was used (Figure 2).

```{r}
ggplot(data = bottle_complete) +
  geom_histogram(aes(chl_a_ug_l), 
                 fill = "darkgreen", 
                 color = "white",
                 bins = 50) +
  labs(x = "[Chlorophyll-a] (\u03BCg/L)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Chl-a Distribution",
       caption = "Fig 1. Distribution of chlorophyll-a concentrations in coastal water samples.") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0))
  
```

A new column was added, the log of chlorphyll-*a* concentration, and was utilized in the following regression model.

```{r}
# add log(chl-a) column
bottle_complete <- bottle_complete %>% 
  mutate(log_chla = log(chl_a_ug_l))

# check distributions again
ggplot(data = bottle_complete) +
  geom_histogram(aes(log_chla), 
                 fill = "darkgreen", 
                 color = "white") +
  labs(x = "log[Chlorophyll-a]",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "log(chl-a) Distribution",
       caption = "Fig 2. Distribution of the log of chlorophyll-a concentration.") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0)) 
```

## Regression

Now that the log of chlorophyll-*a* concentration lowers the leverage of large values, multiple linear regression was implemented
to answer my question. Nitrogen and phosphorous are co-limiting nutrients and phytoplankton rely on a certain ratio of nutrients for optimal growth -- which is known as the Redfield Ratio. Due to this, the response of phytoplankton to each nutrient can actually depend on the supply of the other (Frost et al 2023). Due to this phenomenon, an interaction term between phosphorous and dissolved inorganic nitrogen was included in the regression model.

```{r}
# multiple linear regression with interaction term
model <- lm(log_chla ~ po4_umol_l + din_umol_l + din_umol_l:po4_umol_l, data = bottle_complete)

# sjplot for clean output table
sjPlot::tab_model(model, digits = 3, show.se = TRUE, 
                  title = "Table 1. Summary of log-linear multiple regression model with interaction term.", string.se = "SE") 
```

### Coefficient Interpretations

This model produces a lot of outputs, so let's interpret what each coefficient value means:

-   `(Intercept)`: the exponential of the intercept
    (`r round(exp(model$coefficients['(Intercept)']),3)`) is the
    predicted concentration of chlorophyll-*a* in ug/L when the
    concentrations of both phosphate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen
    are zero.
-   `po4 umol l`: a one micro mole per liter increase in phosphate
    changes the concentration of chlorophyll-*a* by
    `r round(model$coefficients['po4_umol_l'],3)*100`%, when there is no
    dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water.
-   `din_umol_l`: a one micro mole per liter increase in dissolved
    inorganic nitrogen changes the concentration of chlorophyll-*a* by
    `r round(model$coefficients['din_umol_l'],3)*100`%, when there is no
    phosphate in the water.
-   `po4 umol l x din umol l`: Since both parameters in the interaction
    term are continuous variables, this coefficient describes the
    marginal effect of both nutrients on each other's slope of their
    relationship with log(chlorophyll-*a*):
    -   effect of
        phosphate:`r round(model$coefficients['po4_umol_l'],2)` +
        `r round(model$coefficients['po4_umol_l:din_umol_l'],2)`\*DIN
    -   effect of nitrogen:
        `r round(model$coefficients['din_umol_l'],2)` +
        `r round(model$coefficients['po4_umol_l:din_umol_l'],2)`\*PO4

### Marginal effects

Since the interaction is between two continuous variables, the slope of
one nutrient's relationship with chlorphyll-a is conditional on the
concentration of the other. This is called the marginal effect. We can actually plot
the marginal effects of phosphate and nitrogen on each other to better visualize:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkarreth/JKmisc/master/ggintfun.R")

ggintfun(obj = model, varnames = c("po4_umol_l", "din_umol_l"), 
         varlabs = c("Phosphate", "Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen"),
         title = FALSE, rug = TRUE,
         twoways = TRUE)
```

![Fig 3. Marginal effects of phosphate (left) and dissolved inorganic
nitrogen (right)](marginal_effects.png) Fig 3. Marginal effects of
phosphate (left) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (right).

## Discussion

All of the coeefficients of the regression model are significant at a significance level of $\alpha = 0.01$ (Table 1). Therefore this relationship between chlorophyll-*a* and phosphate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen can be considered statistically significant. However, when investigating the relationship between the two nutrients, phosphate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen are colinear (Figure 4). Due to this, the coefficients in Table 1 must be considered with confidence because the model could be very sensitive to changes in the nutrient concentrations. Additionally, although the coefficients may appear significant, the adjusted $R^2$, `r round(summary(model)$adj.r.squared,2)`, indicates that these nutrients explain very little of the total variability in chlorphyll-*a*.

```{r}
ggplot(data = bottle_complete, aes(x = din_umol_l, y = po4_umol_l)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (\u03BCmol/L)",
       y = "Phosphate (\u03BCmol/L)",
       caption = "Fig 4. Relationship between measured dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate demonstrating collinearity") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE,
              color = "darkseagreen") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 25)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, 3)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))
```

## Conclusion

Although nutrients play a large role in chlorophyll-*a* concentration, and therefore phytoplankton biomass, there are other drivers with high importance including temperature and available light. Future work should include isolating and controlling for temperature and light availability to better characterize the relationship between chlorophyll-*a* and nutrients. Once a better model fit is constructed, further work could include investigating the affect of site and depth in the channel have on this relationship.
